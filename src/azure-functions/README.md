# Azure Functions

## What you can and can not expect

This training is designed to give you a fundamental understanding of _Azure Functions_, how they work and what you can do with it as well as some best practices for developers.

This training is not designed as a exhaustive coding guide.
There are samples, but they will be limited to showcase certain scenarios.

> Note: The Azure Resources we're going to allocate are **not free of charge**. We'll clean them up after the training, however.
