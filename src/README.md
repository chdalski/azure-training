# Introduction

This book is created with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

## Trainings

As of now, there's just one for Azure Functions.
If time allows, however, I'll add more.

## How to work with the book

### Select headlines as anchors

You can select headlines as anchors just by clicking on them.
This will give a deep link to specific headline and I recommend it if you take a break or want to reference a specific part of the training.

### Code blocks

Code blocks, commands and output snippet are embedded like:

```json
{
  "this": "is a json example"
}
```

You can copy the code block into your local clipboard to allow pasting into another application.

### Tasks

The book contains certain tasks where you're expected to do something.
Some of them are marked as optional.

Tasks are marked like this: <span class="task">ðŸ›  TASK</span>.

Task come with hints and solutions, but the former is optional.
Just click on the text to reveal what's hidden.

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ’¡ HINT</summary>

This is a **hint**!

</details>
<br/>
<details>
  <summary>ðŸŽ“ SOLUTION</summary>

This is the **solution**!

</details>

### Quizzes

Chapters might also contain quizzes.

A quiz is marked like this: <span class="quiz">Quiz</span>

Quizzes are simple Q&As and work exactly like [tasks](#tasks).
